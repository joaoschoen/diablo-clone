# Contributing

First, thank you for contributing! I encourage pull requests from everyone.

Before submitting major changes, here are a few guidelines to follow:

1. Open an [issue][issues] first, to discuss a new feature or enhancement.
1. Open a [pull request][prs], and reference the relevant issue(s).
1. After receiving feedback, merge and add a [great commit message][message].
1. Have fun!
